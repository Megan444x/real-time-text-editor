This repository contains a Node.js server application built with the Express framework, specifically designed to facilitate real-time collaborative document editing and management. At its core, the server uses Socket.IO to manage WebSocket connections, enabling instantaneous communication between connected clients for a seamless collaborative experience. Key features include WebSocket event listeners for handling user connections, broadcasting document changes in real time, and managing disconnections gracefully.

Additionally, the server offers RESTful API endpoints supporting user authentication processes, comprehensive document management tasks (such as creation, update, and deletion), and functionality to retrieve the history of document changes. This setup ensures a robust back-end solution that can serve as the backbone for applications requiring real-time data synchronization and collaboration capabilities, all while maintaining a secure and reliable user authentication system.
